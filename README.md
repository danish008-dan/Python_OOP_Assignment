# Python_OOP_Assignment
This repository contains a comprehensive set of Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercises, ranging from basic class creation to advanced concepts such as inheritance, method overriding, encapsulation, multiple inheritance, and property decorators.

The exercises are designed to strengthen core OOP concepts with clean, readable, and well-documented Python code.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles

📂 Exercises Included
✅ Exercise 1: Create a Class with Instance Attributes

Implemented a Vehicle class with:

max_speed

mileage

Demonstrates object creation and attribute access.

✅ Exercise 2: Empty Class Definition

Created a Vehicle class with no variables or methods using the pass keyword.

Useful for placeholder or future expansion.

✅ Exercise 3: Class Inheritance

Created a Bus class inheriting from Vehicle.

Demonstrates:

Parent constructor reuse

Attribute inheritance

✅ Exercise 4: Method Overriding with Default Arguments

Overridden seating_capacity() method in Bus.

Used default argument value (capacity = 50).

Demonstrates super() usage.

✅ Exercise 5: Class Attributes

Defined a shared class attribute color.

Demonstrated how class attributes are shared across objects.

✅ Exercise 6: Method Overriding & Fare Calculation

Implemented fare calculation logic:

Base fare = capacity × 100

Bus adds 10% maintenance charge

Demonstrates real-world use of method overriding.

✅ Exercise 7: Object Type Checking

Used type() to identify the class of an object.

✅ Exercise 8: Instance Checking

Used isinstance() to verify inheritance relationship.

✅ Exercise 9: Multiple Inheritance & MRO

Implemented multiple inheritance using:

Engine class

ElectricFeature class

Created ElectricCar class inheriting from both.

Demonstrated Method Resolution Order (MRO).

✅ Exercise 10: Encapsulation using @property

Implemented BankAccount class with:

Private balance (__balance)

Getter and setter using @property

Validation to prevent negative balance

Included deposit and withdrawal operations.
